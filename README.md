Let us try to replicate it.

In the process of replicatin the site. Replicated the header section of the website

Document the steps. What all needs to be done.

1. Header with icon and navbar
2. Main section -1 --> two line intro with two images
3. Main section -2 --> a little background. Then there is what all expertise is there
4. Main section -3 --> recent work with different companies
5. Main section -5 --> Companies with whih collaborated
6. Main section -6 --> Startup products created
7. Main section -7 --> Testimonials
