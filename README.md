# portfolioProjectWithHTMLCSS

This is a portfolio project I will be working on. Mostly I will use vanilla html,css and Javascript

Sites referred for inspiration

Spend 1 hour tomorrow and put in few sites for inspiration here

Then build a basic structure of the website. What all links I want. Just a high level structure to keep me going
