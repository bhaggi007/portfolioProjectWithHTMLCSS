# portfolioProjectWithHTMLCSS

This is a portfolio project I will be working on. Mostly I will use vanilla html,css and Javascript

Sites referred for inspiration

Spend 1 hour tomorrow and put in few sites for inspiration here

Then build a basic structure of the website. What all links I want. Just a high level structure to keep me going

15 Portfolio from other developers for inspiration

1. Portfolio website of Matt (@farleymatters)
   A very clean design and all the necessary details included. The website loads very fast, thus improving the ux.

Step 1
Let me try to make a replica of the site I liked. Will start from here. Once done can refactor and change

I found below site very nice.
https://mattfarley.ca/

Let us try to replicate it.

In the process of replicatin the site. Replicated the header section of the website

Document the steps. What all needs to be done.
So what I see is this website has x sections

1. Header with icon and navbar
2. Main section -1 --> two line intro with two images
3. Main section -2 --> a little background. Then there is what all expertise is there
4. Main section -3 --> recent work with different companies
5. Main section -4 --> Companies with whih collaborated
6. Main section -5 --> Startup products created
7. Main section -6 --> Testimonials
8. Footer section --> for connecting and collaborating

Let us try to build it section by section

Blockers

1. I need to have a containers, that does the left and right alignment properly. --> resolved it for now with 10% margin always on left and right. I want to do this with margin auto

Issues with each component

1. Header with icon and navbar
   Issues
   a. Need to put a different icon. Learn to create your icon and then put it here.
   b. Need to style the links. It is looking very upgly at this moment.
   c. The links should be in same horizontal line as the icon.
2. Main section -1 --> two line intro with two images
   Issues
   a. Need to create the images, and then put it here.
3. Main section -2 --> a little background. Then there is what all expertise is there
   Issues
   a. Put a different background color here, to make it stand out from previous section
   b. Need to style the paragraph

Work on below still needs to be started 4. Main section -3 --> recent work with different companies 5. Main section -4 --> Companies with whih collaborated 6. Main section -5 --> Startup products created 7. Main section -6 --> Testimonials 8. Footer section --> for connecting and collaborating
